This repository presents a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health indicators. By leveraging a dataset containing patient information such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, the model employs advanced algorithms to identify patterns and correlations associated with heart disease.

Key features of this project include:
1)Data preprocessing and exploration to understand the dataset

2)Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)

3)Model evaluation and comparison to select the best-performing model

4)Potential for integration into healthcare systems for early disease detection

This project aims to contribute to the early detection and prevention of heart disease through the power of machine learning.
